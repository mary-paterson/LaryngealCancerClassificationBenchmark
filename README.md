# A Classification Benchmark for Artificial Intelligence Detection of Laryngeal Cancer from Patient Speech

This repository provides all code created for the paper **A Classification Benchmark for Artificial Intelligence Detection of Laryngeal Cancer from Patient Speech** which can be found here. 

In this work we present 36 models for the classification of benign and malignant voice disorders. The models were trained using data from the [Far Eastern Memorial Hospital](http://www.femh-voice-database.org) and external evaluation was performed using the [Saarbruecken Voice Database](https://stimmdb.coli.uni-saarland.de/help_en.php4).

This reporitory gives the code required to make predictions using the trained models presented in this work in the 'Predict Audio' folder. To train new models code can be found in the 'Model Training' folder. Code used to extract audio features can be found in the 'Feature Extraction' folder.

The environment requirements can be found in requirements.txt
